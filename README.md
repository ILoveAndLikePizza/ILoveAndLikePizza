# ILoveAndLikePizza

Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! As you already noticed, I love and like pizza, but also:
- my website [N&M Games](https://nm-games.eu)
- the organization I am linked to, [DJO Amersfoort](https://github.com/djoamersfoort)
- the fact that I made my GitHub account in 2019. I don't know why, but I love and like it.

## My repositories
My first repository was for some micro:bit stuff which never actually became in development.  
Furthermore, I made some Windows desktop applications which only work on Windows. VS2022 doesn't want me to make Linux builds.

**That is it, I guess! Have fun looking around!**
